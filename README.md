# My Personal Project: Brick Break Game

## Overview

This application will contain a simple game in which the user clears various bricks in the scene by hitting a moving 
ball with a paddle. **Anyone** with access to a computer can play the game, including but not limited to:
- Kids
- Adults
- Seniors

This project is of interest to me because I've wanted to learn to code a game since elementary school. I think this game
is a suitable complexity to attempt since the physics is relatively simple, and it's possible to customize features to 
make the game more interesting over time. The design is inspired by the arcade game *Atari Breakout.*

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to control the paddle
- As a user, I want to be able to pause the game
- As a user, I want to be able to restart the game
- As a user, I want to create a specific sized list of bricks at the start of the game
- As a user, I want to have an option to save my game from the pause menu
- As a user, I want to have an option to load my save file when starting the game
