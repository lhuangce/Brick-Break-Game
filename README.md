## Brick Break Game

This application will contain a simple game in which the user clears various bricks in the scene by hitting a moving 
ball with a paddle. **Anyone** with access to a computer can play the game, including but not limited to:
- Kids
- Adults
- Seniors

This project is of interest to me because I've wanted to learn to code a game since elementary school. I think this game
is a suitable complexity to attempt since the physics is relatively simple, and it's possible to customize features to 
make the game more interesting over time. The design is inspired by the arcade game *Atari Breakout.*
